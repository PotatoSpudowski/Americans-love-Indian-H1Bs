# Americans-love-Indian-H1Bs

A Chrome extension that transforms anti-Indian and anti-H1B rhetoric into pro-immigration messages, highlighting the absurdity of xenophobic comments on social media.

## About

This extension was created in response to the increasing wave of discriminatory comments and racist rhetoric targeting Indian tech workers and H1B visa holders on social media platforms. Instead of letting hate speech proliferate, this extension automatically converts negative comments into positive advocacy for Indian professionals and the H1B program.

The goal is to:
- Combat xenophobia with humor
- Highlight the valuable contributions of Indian professionals to the tech industry
- Demonstrate the absurdity of racist rhetoric
- Promote a more inclusive dialogue about immigration
